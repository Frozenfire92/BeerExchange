# BeerExchange
Find out who to give your dev beer to

## Problem
Given a list of people's names, organize a beer exchange such that each person is randomly assigned someone else to give a beer to, and someone to receive a beer from.
Caveat: The person cannot receive a beer from the same person to whom they are gifting one.

## Solution
I have thought about a mathematical proof to count how many solutions there are given a number of people n.
I have also asked professors at my University and it doesn't immediately seem there is a nice or intuitive solution.
If you come up with one please let me know!

I coded my solution in javascript with underscore.js
